# Epilepsy-EEG-Detection
An AI-powered approach for detecting epileptic seizures using EEG signals and machine learning algorithms.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on automated epilepsy detection using EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals and advanced machine learning models. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Traditional methods of seizure detection rely on manual EEG analysis, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to automate seizure detection using machine learning techniques for higher accuracy and efficiency.
